# Introduction
In India, bands are not able to get together easily. To bridge this gap and create new opportunities for amateur artists we thought of Aria. It would revolutionize the music scene, as it delocalizes the bands and provides the opportunity to form bands without the restraints of location. We also thought of other features to provide ease for the music artists and music enthusiasts.

# Features
Aria was inspired in order to form a community of amateur artists who support and lift each other. It is a platform that provides a place to form new bands and a place where people can connect in order to communicate and jam together via jam rooms based on different genres. It also gives upcoming artists the opportunity to get in the eyes of the public, as it has a leader board feature. We also have the option of buying and selling musical instruments. We also plan on organizing events with the amateur bands in order to promote them.
